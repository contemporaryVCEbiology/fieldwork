                    <h3>Part 1 - Introduction</h3>
                    <p>An introduction to Deakin University biological scientist Dr Anneke Veenstra is followed by a description of her research work in the invertebrate ecology; specifically, that of the Gardiner’s Creek Reserve in Burwood, Victoria, Australia. Google Earth is used to provide a “fly in” view of the inner urban location of the Reserve.</p>

                    <h3>Part 2 - The need for the research</h3>
                    <p>Dr Veenstra explains that there is little known about the insects that live in urban environments. There is a need for scientific research to identify the different species presently living in the environment; including their numbers and distribution. Changes can then be monitored. Such knowledge is invaluable for making informed management decisions aimed at ensuring the ongoing health of the ecosystem.</p>
                    
                </div>

                <div role="tabpanel" id="part3-tab" aria-labelledby="part3" hidden>
                    <h3>Part 3 – How was the research conducted</h3>
                    <p>Research usually begins with a question and perhaps an associated hypothesis. The research question will establish the data to be collected. Dr Veenstra explains that before collecting any data in a public park, it is essential to gain permission from management authorities.</p>
                    
                </div>
                
                <div role="tabpanel" id="part4-tab" aria-labelledby="part4" hidden>
                    <h3>Part 4 – Preparation</h3>
                    <p>Dr Veenstra explains that fieldwork involves making many decisions about what data is to be collected as well as where and how it will be collected.  A preliminary visit to the site is needed so that important characteristics can be ascertained; including the types and distribution of vegetation, likely locations for pitfall traps to collect invertebrate specimens and possible positioning of environmental data loggers. Photographing the site provides a record of data collection locations.</p>
                    
                </div>

                <div role="tabpanel" id="part5-tab" aria-labelledby="part5" hidden>
                    <h3>Part 5 - Recording data</h3>
                    <p>In invertebrate studies, the individuals that fall into each pitfall trap are counted and identified using reference to large collections of specimens. Dr Veenstra explains that a reference collection is created for future comparison.  Records are kept so that similar future pitfall trap data can be compared to see what changes in populations, diversity and distribution of species have occurred over time.</p>
                    
                </div>

                <div role="tabpanel" id="part6-tab" aria-labelledby="part6" hidden>
                    <h3>Part 6 – Discoveries</h3>
                    <p>Gardner’s Creek Reserve is highly impacted by human activity.  Nevertheless, as Dr Veenstra explains, to her amazement there is a remarkable diversity of invertebrate species living in the reserve.  With little previous research on invertebrates in this urban area, careful data collection and analysis has led to discoveries of the presence of species not previously known to exist in this location, as well as the discovery of a previously unknown species.  Because invertebrates are at the bottom of the food chain, changes in their numbers affect other species.  Knowledge about invertebrate species abundance and distribution provide useful information for future management decisions.</p>

                <div role="tabpanel" id="part7-tab" aria-labelledby="part7" hidden>
                    <h3>Part 7 - How can the research be used</h3>
                    <p>Dr Veenstra explains that the local council has shown an interest in the findings of her research.  The research can provide information about whether revegetation and preserving some areas by fencing them off is having an impact on enhancing the health of the ecosystem.</p>
                    
                </div>

                <div role="tabpanel" id="part8-tab" aria-labelledby="part8" hidden>
                    <h3>Part 8 – Presenting your findings</h3>
                    <p>Research findings need to be communicated, Dr. Veenstra argues. Importantly they need to be communicated in ways that are appropriate for different target audiences. Using graphs rather than tables of data, common names or images of species, rather than scientific names, can make the findings of the research accessible for an audience of non-scientists.</p>
                    
                </div>


                <div role="tabpanel" id="part9-tab" aria-labelledby="part9" hidden>
                    <h3>Part 9 - The challenge of conducting research out in the field</h3>
                    <p>In this part, Dr. Veenstra shares some tips for addressing the various challenges confronting the field research worker.  Weather, people, and animals can interfere with or destroy the data being collected in pitfall traps, and precautions need to be taken to minimise these problems.  It is essential to have contingency plans.</p>
                    <p>While in the field it is important to record as much as possible in your field notebook and to photograph locations, as well as animal and plant specimens observed. Using these records, it will be possible to return to the same sites used before and to spot changes that may have occurred.</p>

                    <h3>Part 10 - Things to look out for</h3>
                    <p>Further tips about careful preparation are provided by Dr Veenstra in this part. She explains that attention to simple things, such as careful labelling is essential, so that the locations at which specimens have been collected are not forgotten, and invaluable data is not lost.  Thorough preparation, together with meticulous and detailed recording of data are essential for successful fieldwork.</p>

                    <h3>Part 11 Assistance, Guides and Resources</h3>
                    <p>Suggestions of resources for help with invertebrate studies is provided in this part. The CSIRO provides online keys for invertebrates. An invertebrate collection manual is also available online.  Using these resources it is possible for anyone to conduct their own studies and compare them with those done by scientists.</p>

                <div role="tabpanel" id="part12-tab" aria-labelledby="part12" hidden>
                    <h3>Part 12 Sharing the Research</h3>
                    <p>Dr Veenstra encourages anyone who collects data on invertebrate biology to publish it.  If not in print then online.  This way others can build on the research that has been done. There is too much work for a few scientists to do, says Dr Veenstra, but if many people use the same techniques to collect data and this data is published, analysis of the combined data can give valuable scientific insights.  As well as publishing successes, it is important to share experiences of failures and difficulties that might help others more successfully carry out their fieldwork.</p>

                    <h3>Part 13 - Where to next and Inspiration</h3>
                    <p>In this final part, Dr Veenstra shares her passion for science and invertebrate biology.  There is so much still to be discovered, she explains. This provides the fieldwork researcher with abundant opportunities to make their own scientific discoveries, such as describing and naming invertebrate species that have never been recorded before.</p>

                <h2>About Dr Veenstra</h2>
                <p>My current research interest is the taxonomy, phylogeny and ecology of previously undescribed gall midge species infesting saltmarsh plants and other Australian native vascular plants in collaboration with Dr Peter Kolesik (Bionomics Pty. Ltd).  This research has significant practical applications as members of the family Cecidomyiidae are host-plant specific and known to impair the sexual reproduction of native plants. Recent research also includes identification of the fungus that may provide food for developing gall midge larvae, using DNA analysis and histological techniques in collaboration with Dr Teresa Lebel (Senior Mycologist) from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Victoria.</p>
                <p>Despite many gall midges existing in Australia comparatively few have been formally described. For formal description the midge’s appearance and biology can be insufficient – DNA analysis is necessary. Worldwide, DNA fingerprinting of Cecidomyiidae is in its infancy with few laboratories using this technique.</p>
